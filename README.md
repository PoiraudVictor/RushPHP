# 42_RushPHP
One of the first PHP project of Ecole 42, made in 1 day and a half with my mate. The project is not finished as time was limited.
This project is part of a 2 weeks "Piscine" PHP, the beginning 7/7 ~2 weeks bootcamp of Web cursus at Ecole 42. 
To run the project :

First install a local web server of your choice ([MAMP](https://bitnami.com/stack/mamp/installer), [WAMP](https://bitnami.com/stack/wamp/installer), [LAMP](https://bitnami.com/stack/lamp/installer))

Then go to the mampstack repo and cd to htdocs in apache2

```bash
cd apache2/htdocs
```

Create a symbolic link to the RushPHP repo

```bash
ln -s <the path to your 42_RushPHP repo>
```

Or copy all the files in the 42_RushPHP repo inside the htdocs folder.

Finally, start your server and go to localhost:8080 in your browser !
